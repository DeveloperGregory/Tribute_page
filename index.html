                <p id='paragraph-1'>Shigeru Miyamoto was born on November 16, 1952 in Kyoto, Japan.  Who would of guessed that
                    he would grow up to be one of the most influential people in video game history.  
                </p>
                <p id='paragraph-2'>He started working for Nintendo in 1977 after getting an interview with the help of his 
                    father's friend.  He started as an apprentice in Nintendo's planning department.  Some of 
                    his earlier projects are Sheriff and Radar Scope.  From there Shigeru Miyamoto has created 
                    some of the most iconic characters in video game history.
                </p>
                <p id='paragraph-3'>However, Shigeru Miyamoto is probably best known for the creation of Super Mario and 
                    The Legend of Zelda.</p>  
                                    
                <p id='paragraph-4'>In 1981 Nintendo was trying to find a way to make a success 
                    in the North American market.  They decided to take unsold units of Radar Scope and 
                    make a new arcade game.  Originally Nintendo tried to secure rights to Popeye but were
                    unable to obtain the license.  So Shigeru thought of what makes Popeye the most interesting
                    and decided that the love triangle between Olive Oyl, Bruto, and Popeye is the defining
                    premise of the cartoon so he decided to have a love triangle between a Princess, a Gorilla, and
                    a carpenter.  The game was called Donkey Kong and was a huge success.  In 1983 he reworked Jumpman 
                    as the carpenter was called in Donkey Kong and changed him to a plumber named Mario.  He created a 
                    brother for Mario named Luigi and released Mario Bros. to the arcades.  Again Mario Bros. was a huge 
                    success.  In 1985 Nintendo busted on to the home market with their Nintentdo Entertainment System TV 
                    console.  They packaged Miyamoto's new game Super Mario Bros. with the console and as they say the rest 
                    is history.</p>
                <p id='paragraph-5'>In 1986 Shigeru Miyamoto started working on a new game.  This one would be open world and focus on exploration
                    and discovery.  He based the game on his adventures as a child exploring Kyoto.  The game would eventually
                    be called the Lengend of Zelda.  Which has gone on to spawn multiple sequels.</p>
                
                <p id='paragraph-6'>Both franchises are still hugely popular to this day and each release of a new game is eagerly anticipated
                    by the gaming community. </p> 
                
                <p id='paragraph-7'>So thank you Shigeru Miyamoto for giving us so many great memories.</p>
