            <p>Shigeru Miyamoto was born on November 16, 1952 in Kyoto, Japan.  Who would of guessed that
                he would grow up to be one of the most influential people in video game history.  
            </p>
            <p>He started working for Nintendo in 1977 after getting an interview with the help of his 
                father's friend.  He started as an apprentice in Nintendo's planning department.  Some of 
                his earlier projects are Sheriff and Radar Scope.
            </p>
            <p>But Shigeru Miyamoto is probably best known for the creation of Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda
